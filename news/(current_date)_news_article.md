Here are the actual complete content about global warming in 2025 to keep you well informed.

## 1. January 2025 was the warmest on record globally, despite an emerging La Niña

January 2025 was the warmest January globally, with an average surface air temperature of 13.23°C, 0.79°C above the 1991-2020 average. This warmth was particularly notable over western North America, northeastern Africa, and the Weddell Sea region of Antarctica, where temperatures were more than 4°C above average in some areas. In contrast, western and southern Europe, parts of central Asia, and eastern Antarctica saw temperatures that were below average.

The warmth in January followed a very warm end to 2024, with December 2024 having been the second warmest December on record. The 12-month period from February 2023 to January 2025 was the warmest 12-month period on record, highlighting the long-term warming trend.

Despite the emerging La Niña conditions in the tropical Pacific, which typically have a cooling effect on global temperatures, January 2025 was still the warmest on record. This is consistent with the overall long-term warming trend, which is attributable to human-induced climate change.

The data presented here is from the ERA5 dataset, which is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), implemented by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) on behalf of the European Union. The ERA5 dataset provides a comprehensive and up-to-date assessment of the Earth's climate, using a combination of observations and models to produce a consistent and accurate representation of the atmosphere, ocean, and land surface.

According to NCEI's Global Annual Temperature Outlook, there is a 7% chance that 2025 will rank as the warmest year on record. The new January temperature data reinforces the long-term warming trend, with global temperatures continuing to rise. The report highlights the significance of human-induced climate change and the urgent need for global action to mitigate its impacts.

## 3. Project 2025 Would Jeopardize Global Climate Action

Project 2025 threatens collective, global action on climate change by advocating for the United States to step away from formal engagement in international climate efforts. This move could undermine global cooperation and hinder progress toward achieving critical climate goals. The project's proponents argue for a more isolationist approach, which climate experts warn could have severe consequences for global warming mitigation efforts.

According to UN Climate Action, warming of 1.5°C to 2°C will cause most terrestrial species ranges to shrink dramatically. Changes in ranges can adversely affect ecosystems and biodiversity, leading to cascading effects on food security, water resources, and human health. The report emphasizes the need for urgent and ambitious climate action to prevent the most severe impacts of global warming.

## 5. Climate news to watch in 2025

America's aging forests are starting to remove less carbon from the atmosphere each year. Forestry or other natural climate solutions, which have been relied upon to offset emissions, are becoming less effective. This trend underscores the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and implementing sustainable land-use practices to combat climate change.

Technological advancements in carbon capture, green hydrogen, and battery storage hold promise for achieving key climate goals. These innovations could significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy. However, challenges remain in scaling up these technologies and ensuring their widespread adoption.

2 Protecting nature
3 Who's going to pay for all this?
4 Laying down the law
5 Plastic pollution.

## 9. A year above 1.5 °C signals that Earth is most probably within the 20-year period with an average warming of 1.5 °C

Here we show that, without very stringent climate mitigation, the first year above 1.5 °C occurs within the first 20-year period with an average warming of 1.5 °C. This finding underscores the urgency of implementing robust climate policies to prevent the most severe impacts of global warming.

## 10. What is the global warming prediction for 2025?

The forecast anticipates a global mean temperature in the range of 1.35 °C to 1.55 °C above the pre-industrial value, meaning global temperatures in 2025 will remain at least 1.0 °C above pre-industrial levels for the 12th consecutive year. This prediction highlights the continuing trend of global warming and the need for urgent climate action.

The climate crisis in 2025 encompasses various aspects, including current climate change progress, ways to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, and international efforts to combat climate change. This overview provides a comprehensive look at the current state of climate change and the actions needed to address it.

## Key Climate Issues to Watch in 2025

1. **Keeping 1.5°C Alive**: Efforts to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.
2. **Protecting Nature**: Initiatives to safeguard ecosystems and biodiversity.
3. **Funding Climate Action**: Addressing the financial aspects of climate mitigation and adaptation.
4. **Legal Frameworks**: Establishing and enforcing laws to combat climate change.
5. **Plastic Pollution**: Tackling the environmental impact of plastic waste.

## Urgency of Climate Mitigation

Without very stringent climate mitigation, the first year above 1.5°C is likely to occur within the first 20-year period with an average warming of 1.5°C. This finding underscores the urgency of implementing robust climate policies to prevent the most severe impacts of global warming.

## Global Warming Prediction for 2025

The forecast anticipates a global mean temperature in the range of 1.35°C to 1.55°C above pre-industrial levels. This means global temperatures in 2025 will remain at least 1.0°C above pre-industrial levels for the 12th consecutive year, highlighting the continuing trend of global warming and the need for urgent climate action.
